# Lancaster Library Mimic

This project is was created as an assignment during the **INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION** class  of Computer Science Department. It concerns a static website with no functionality and its sole purpose is to mimic the interface as it appears in the screenshots of the original Lancaster Library Website (contained inside the project folder).

 
All needed assets are included.
